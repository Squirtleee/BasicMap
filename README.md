A basic map tool I built during a summer course. The map covers the area around Stanford University. 

Instructions:

2. Click on "+" to enlarge the map and "-" to shirk the map.
3. Double click on map to make the doublic clicked position your new viewing center.
4. Click and drag the map for more precise navigation.
